STATUS: DRAFT
LOCK: FIXED
VERSION: 1.0.0

CHANGE_NOTE:
- DATE: 2026-01-14
- TYPE: MAJOR
- SUMMARY: "Created MARKETING topics realm README: scope boundaries, usage order, and roadmap for positioning, packaging, distribution, and growth mechanics."
- REASON: "Entities need structured marketing knowledge to package and distribute outputs consistently, without mixing it into creative craft or governance."
- IMPACT: "Clearer positioning, more consistent release packs, better channel fit."

## 0) PURPOSE (KB)
This realm contains MARKETING craft knowledge:
- positioning and message clarity
- audience segmentation and channel fit
- packaging (titles, thumbnails principles, hooks in copy)
- distribution mechanics (where/how to publish)
- growth loops and engagement mechanics (measurable)
- marketing QA gates (clarity, promise/payoff, channel compliance)

Goal:
- make outputs discoverable and understandable to the target audience.

---

## 1) WHAT BELONGS HERE / WHAT DOES NOT
### BELONGS (IN-SCOPE)
- positioning framework (who/what/why now)
- audience segments (needs, language, triggers)
- value proposition crafting
- packaging formats (title/description structure, CTA patterns)
- channel distribution playbooks (platform fit)
- metrics and feedback loops (operational)
- compliance constraints per platform (as checklists/gates)

### DOES NOT BELONG (OUT-OF-SCOPE)
- narrative craft (10_NARRATIVE)
- character/world craft (20/30)
- cinematography/camera craft (40_VISUAL)
- music craft (50_SOUND_MUSIC)
- production pipeline mechanics (60_PRODUCTION)
- governance laws and navigation maps (master index only)

---

## 2) NAVIGATION RULE (STRICT)
- This README is NOT navigation authority.
- KB navigation/existence authority is ONLY:
  - `04_KNOWLEDGE_BASE/00__INDEX__KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md`
- Do not add RAW registries here.

---

## 3) HOW ENTITIES USE MARKETING TOPICS (DETERMINISTIC)
Order:
1) Load governance minimum set (no-fantasy, uid-only xref, trace).
2) Define the marketing task:
   - positioning
   - packaging (titles/copy)
   - distribution plan
   - campaign loop
3) Load minimal required modules:
   - constraints/gates first
   - then packaging/playbooks
4) Validate using marketing checklists/gates.
5) Output RUN_TRACE.

---

## 4) FILL PLAN (ROADMAP: WHAT FILES WE MUST CREATE)
Roadmap list (not navigation authority).

### P1 — Clarity & positioning
- MARKETING__POSITIONING_FOUNDATIONS (who/what/why)
- MARKETING__VALUE_PROPOSITION_TEMPLATE
- MARKETING__AUDIENCE_SEGMENT_MAP_METHOD

### P1 — Packaging (high leverage)
- MARKETING__TITLE_HOOK_PATTERNS (principles + anti-clickbait constraints)
- MARKETING__DESCRIPTION_STRUCTURE (promise→proof→CTA)
- MARKETING__VISUAL_PACKAGING_PRINCIPLES (thumbnail/poster constraints, not camera craft)

### P1 — Distribution mechanics
- MARKETING__CHANNEL_FIT_CHECKLIST (platform→format fit)
- MARKETING__RELEASE_PACK_CHECKLIST (assets + copy)

### P2 — Growth loops
- MARKETING__ENGAGEMENT_LOOP_DESIGN
- MARKETING__UGC_TRIGGER_MECHANICS (where relevant)
- MARKETING__A_B_TEST_LOGIC (operational)

### P3 — Advanced
- MARKETING__COMMUNITY_BUILDING_PLAYBOOK
- MARKETING__MONETIZATION_LADDER_METHOD

---

## 5) STYLE RULES FOR MARKETING MODULES
- Prefer measurable checks and templates.
- Avoid “taste-only marketing advice” unless tied to testable outcomes.
- Keep modules atomic (one function per file).
- Keep compliance constraints explicit (pass/fail checklists).

---

## 6) HARD FAIL CONDITIONS
FAIL IF:
- realm becomes a second navigation index (RAW registries)
- modules become generic “marketing course” without operational templates/checks
- clickbait is promoted without guardrails
- outputs claim compliance without trace

---

## 7) RELATED (UID-ONLY)
XREF:
- XREF: UE.KB.RULES.GOV.001 | WHY: governance rules apply everywhere
- XREF: UE.KB.STD.GATE_DEF.088 | WHY: marketing QA gates must be measurable
- XREF: UE.KB.STD.RUN_TRACE_MIN.067 | WHY: trace discipline for KB-driven work
- XREF: UE.KB.RULE.SCOPE_BOUNDARIES.076 | WHY: prevents domain mixing

--- END.
