# SPC PRO PACK — PLAYBOOK (PB-07) — STACKING / HARMONY MINIMAL PLAN (CLARITY-SAFE) (VOCAL_DIRECTOR) (DRAFT)
FILE: 04_KNOWLEDGE_BASE/20_ENTITIES_KB/10_SPC/PRO_PACKS/06_SOUND_MUSIC/07__VOCAL_DIRECTOR_SPC/03__METHOD_PLAYBOOKS/07__PLAYBOOK__STACKING_MINIMAL_PLAN.md

SCOPE: Universe Engine
LAYER: 04_KNOWLEDGE_BASE
REALM: 20_ENTITIES_KB / 10_SPC
PACK_CLASS: SPC_PRO_PACK
DOMAIN: SOUND_MUSIC
DOC_TYPE: PLAYBOOK
LEVEL: L3
STATUS: DRAFT
LOCK: FIXED
VERSION: 0.1.0
UID: UE.KB.SPC.PACK.VOCAL_DIRECTOR.PB.STACKING.001
OWNER: SYSTEM
ROLE: Deterministic workflow for a minimal-first stacking/harmony plan that strengthens hook impact without masking intelligibility. Produces section stacking map, “protected zones” for must-hear targets, and QC rules. No mix/master chains; high-level only.

CHANGE_NOTE:
- DATE: 2026-01-15
- TYPE: MAJOR
- SUMMARY: "Created PB-07 stacking/harmony minimal plan (clarity-safe)."
- REASON: "Backing layers often destroy consonants; this playbook enforces intelligibility protection and minimalism."
- IMPACT: "Hook lift increases while P0 targets remain clear; avoids clutter."
- CHANGE_ID: UE.CHG.2026-01-15.KB.SPC.PACK.VOCAL_DIRECTOR.PB07.001

## 0) PURPOSE
Use this playbook when:
- you want chorus/hook to feel bigger
- you need doubles/backs/harmonies but clarity must not drop
- previous takes sound cluttered or consonants vanish with layers

Primary objective:
- Add the smallest amount of stacking needed to support the hook and arc while protecting must-hear words.

---

## 1) REQUIRED INPUTS (MINIMUM)
STOP/GAP if missing:
- SECTION STRUCTURE
- MUST_HEAR_WORDS / MUST_HEAR_PHRASES (P0/P1)
- VOCAL_STYLE_PROFILE (delivery principles + forbidden styles)

Recommended:
- PERFORMANCE_ARC_MAP
- INTELLIGIBILITY_GATES_CHECKLIST
- any known “masking” issues or density notes

---

## 2) REQUIRED OUTPUTS (MANDATORY)
This playbook MUST produce:
- STACKING_MAP_BY_SECTION (NONE / DOUBLE / BACKS / HARMONY) + rationale
- PROTECTED_ZONES (where stacking must NOT cover P0)
- STACKING_RULES (minimal-first constraints)
- QC_RULES (pass/fail for stacking impact)
- N_A_DECISION (when stacking is not used and why)
- ESCALATION_NOTES (arrangement seat request if needed)
- TRACE (memory/web + gaps)

NOT READY rule:
- If P0 targets are missing → STOP (PB-02 first).

---

## 3) STACKING MODES (ALLOWED SET)
Use only these high-level modes (no mix chain prescriptions):
- NONE: lead only
- DOUBLE: subtle same-line reinforcement (limited)
- BACKS: short supporting lines/words (call/response, emphasis)
- HARMONY: selective hook emphasis (minimal footprint)

Default policy:
- Verse: NONE
- Chorus: DOUBLE or minimal BACKS
- Bridge: NONE or special contrast (only if safe)

---

## 4) PROTECTED ZONES (INTELLIGIBILITY SAFETY)
Protected zones are places stacking must avoid:
- P0 must-hear words/phrases in chorus hook line
- consonant-heavy clusters inside P0 phrases
- breath-critical segments where clarity is already fragile

Rules:
- Never stack over P0 consonant attacks unless the lead stays fully readable.
- If stacking reduces clarity of P0 targets → remove stacking or move it.

---

## 5) WORKFLOW (DETERMINISTIC STEPS)
### STEP 1 — Mark hook carrier + protected zones
1) Identify chorus/hook lines.
2) Mark P0 phrases as protected zones.

### STEP 2 — Choose minimal stacking objective
Pick ONE objective:
- O1: make hook bigger (double only)
- O2: add call/response emphasis (backs)
- O3: add harmonic lift (harmony on selected words)

### STEP 3 — Create STACKING_MAP_BY_SECTION
For each section:
- mode (NONE/DOUBLE/BACKS/HARMONY)
- where exactly (line or word group label)
- why (objective)
Keep it minimal:
- at most 1–2 stacking interventions per chorus in first pass.

### STEP 4 — Define STACKING_RULES
Rules (examples, tune to case):
- Keep verse lead clean (NONE) unless required
- If using DOUBLE, limit to chorus only
- If using BACKS, prefer short call-response fragments outside protected zones
- If using HARMONY, apply only on 1–3 hook words that are not consonant-dense
- Do not stack continuously across the whole chorus

### STEP 5 — QC_RULES (pass/fail)
Pass conditions:
- QC-S1: P0 targets remain understood on first listen (YES/NO)
- QC-S2: stacking increases perceived hook lift (YES/NO)
- QC-S3: no masking artifacts on consonant attacks of P0 (YES/NO)

Fail triggers:
- P0 clarity drops (automatic FAIL)
- chorus becomes cluttered (too many layers)
- stacking changes perceived vocal “character” (identity drift)

### STEP 6 — N/A decision (if no stacking)
If stacking is not used:
- declare N_A_DECISION:
  - why (e.g., clarity fragile; density already high)
  - what alternative lift lever is used (arc/energy/delivery instead)

### STEP 7 — Escalation notes (seat conflicts)
If arrangement density masks P0 regardless of stacking:
- escalate to Arranger/Producer:
  - request space on hook words / reduce competing layer density
No mix chain prescriptions.

---

## 6) COMMON FAIL MODES
- stacking everywhere (kills intelligibility)
- harmonies on consonant-heavy phrases
- doubles in verses (unnecessary clutter)
- no protected zones defined
- trying to “fix clarity” by mixing advice (out of scope)
