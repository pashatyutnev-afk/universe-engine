# CASE — GOOD (KB_SOURCES SOURCE_RECORD EXEMPLAR) (PROMPT_ARCHITECT) (DRAFT)
FILE: 04_KNOWLEDGE_BASE/20_ENTITIES_KB/10_SPC/PRO_PACKS/06_SOUND_MUSIC/12__PROMPT_ARCHITECT_SPC/06__CASE_LIBRARY/23__CASE__GOOD_006.md

SCOPE: Universe Engine
LAYER: 04_KNOWLEDGE_BASE
REALM: 20_ENTITIES_KB / 10_SPC
PACK_CLASS: SPC_PRO_PACK
DOMAIN: SOUND_MUSIC
DOC_TYPE: CASE
LEVEL: L3
STATUS: DRAFT
LOCK: FIXED
VERSION: 0.1.0
UID: UE.KB.SPC.CASE.PROMPT_ARCHITECT.GOOD.006
OWNER: SYSTEM
ROLE: GOOD case calibrating KB_SOURCES behavior: demonstrates a correct SOURCE_RECORD with extracted operational principles, provenance fields, refresh cadence, and "where applied" mapping. Uses placeholders for URL/title if needed; focus is format discipline, not the specific source.

CHANGE_NOTE:
- DATE: 2026-01-15
- TYPE: MAJOR
- SUMMARY: "Added GOOD case #6: KB_SOURCES exemplar SOURCE_RECORD (principles + provenance + refresh + applied mapping)."
- REASON: "Need a positive anchor for provenance discipline without link dump or large text copy."
- IMPACT: "Improves repeatable, safe reuse of world knowledge."
- CHANGE_ID: UE.CHG.2026-01-15.KB.SPC.CASE.GOOD.006

## 0) CASE RECORD
CASE_RECORD:
- CASE_ID: CASE-GOOD-006
- TYPE: GOOD
- CONTEXT:
  - AREA: KB_SOURCES record creation
  - GOAL: add one usable source record (not a dump)
- INPUT_INTENT (short):
  - Convert a source into 5–8 operational prompt principles and map them to pack playbooks/gates.

---

## 1) EXEMPLAR SOURCE_RECORD (FORMAT DISCIPLINE)
SOURCE_RECORD (EXAMPLE):
- SOURCE_UID: SRC-20260115-001
- TITLE: <placeholder title for a high-quality prompting reference>
- SOURCE_TYPE: ARTICLE | BOOK | OFFICIAL_DOC
- AUTHORITY_TIER: T1/T2
- DATE_ACCESSED: 2026-01-15
- LAST_VERIFIED: 2026-01-15
- REFRESH_INTERVAL: 180d
- SCOPE:
  - prompt constraints clarity
  - minimal deltas for iteration
  - repetition control principles
- METHOD QUALITY NOTES:
  - why we trust it: clear methodology / repeated practitioner consensus
  - limitations: platform behavior may change; must be re-verified
- EXTRACTED PRINCIPLES (8):
  - P1: Define a single primary style identity and keep it stable across sections.
  - P2: Use role-based anchors (3–6) instead of long inventories.
  - P3: Allow hook repetition in chorus; enforce novelty in verses.
  - P4: If multiple styles are mentioned, declare dominance (primary vs touch).
  - P5: When fixing issues, change one axis at a time and keep deltas minimal.
  - P6: Use targeted negatives (≤ 8–12) and avoid vague bans.
  - P7: Specify section role ownership for vocals if contrast is required.
  - P8: Record expected effect and decision for each iteration to learn.
- APPLIED_IN_PACK (WHERE):
  - 05__KB_GATES/04__GATE__STYLE_FINGERPRINT_STABILITY.md
  - 05__KB_GATES/05__GATE__ONE_AXIS_CHANGE_DISCIPLINE.md
  - 03__METHOD_PLAYBOOKS/04__PLAYBOOK__PATCH_PROMPT_MINIMAL_CHANGE.md
- CONFLICTS:
  - none
- COPYRIGHT NOTE:
  - "no large text copied; principles paraphrased"

---

## 2) EXPECTED COMPLIANCE OUTCOME (UID-ONLY)
EXPECTED_RESULTS:
- UE.KB.SPC.CHK.PROMPT_ARCHITECT.COMPLIANCE.001 -> PASS
  WHY: KB_SOURCES entry is operational (principles + provenance) and non-copied

---

## 3) WHY THIS IS GOOD (CALIBRATION NOTES)
WHY_GOOD:
- One source → usable operational principles (not links).
- Provenance fields enable refresh discipline.
- "Where applied" mapping ties knowledge to concrete pack components.
- No large quotes; principles are paraphrased and compact.

---

## 4) TRACE
TRACE:
- MEMORY_REUSE: NO
- WEB_LOOKUP_USED: NO

--- END.
