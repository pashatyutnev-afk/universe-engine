SCOPE: Universe Engine
LAYER: 04_KNOWLEDGE_BASE
DOC_TYPE: KB_MODULE
KB_TYPE: STANDARD
LEVEL: L2
STATUS: DRAFT
LOCK: FIXED
VERSION: 1.0.0
UID: UE.KB.STD.SCOPE.MARKETING.016
OWNER: SYSTEM
ROLE: Define the boundaries and required content types for Marketing topics: positioning, segments, packaging, distribution, launch windows, engagement loops, SEO/discovery, and monetization; keeps marketing operational and separate from domain craft and production governance.

CHANGE_NOTE:
- DATE: 2026-01-14
- TYPE: MAJOR
- SUMMARY: "Defined KB_SCOPE.TOPICS.MARKETING boundaries: positioning→packaging→channels→launch→engagement→SEO→monetization."
- REASON: "Marketing must be systematic; without boundaries it becomes vague opinions or mixes with production/music craft."
- IMPACT: "Marketing specialists can generate consistent publish-ready packaging and growth loops with deterministic procedures and QA gates."
- CHANGE_ID: UE.CHG.2026-01-14.KB.STD.016

## 0) PURPOSE (KB)
Marketing topics define how to present and distribute outputs:
- positioning and archetype
- audience segments/personas
- titles/hooks/descriptions/hashtags
- channel strategy and cadence
- launch windows and amplification
- community engagement loops
- SEO/discovery keyword systems
- monetization offers and funnels

Marketing topics are operational and repeatable.

---

## 1) ABSOLUTE BOUNDARIES
Marketing topics must NOT:
- define how to craft the music/story itself (domain craft)
- define production pipeline governance (release pack, QA rubrics belong to Production topics)
- define KB governance or navigation (Meta/Governance)
- embed RAW links or act as an index

Marketing topics MAY:
- reference Production topics for “what must ship” (release packs)
- reference Sound/Music topics for metadata/credits fields, but keep packaging separate from music craft

---

## 2) ALLOWED MARKETING TOPIC TYPES
Allowed:
- POSITIONING & ARCHETYPE (promise + tone + drift guard)
- AUDIENCE SEGMENTS & PERSONAS (JTBD, triggers, channel fit)
- CONTENT PACKAGING (titles/hooks/descriptions/hashtags)
- DISTRIBUTION / CHANNEL STRATEGY (roles, cadence, KPIs)
- LAUNCH CAMPAIGN / RELEASE WINDOW (pre/launch/post)
- COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT LOOPS (polls, A/B, duets, feedback cycles)
- SEO & DISCOVERY (keyword buckets, intent mapping, anti-spam)
- MONETIZATION STRATEGY (asset inventory, offer ladder, funnel mapping)

---

## 3) FORBIDDEN MARKETING CONTENT
Forbidden:
- “how to mix the track” (music craft)
- “hook engineering inside the song” (music craft)
- “release pack schema and QA gates” (production)
- “how KB works” (meta)
- long opinion essays without procedure/templates/QA

---

## 4) REQUIRED STRUCTURE (MINIMUM)
Each Marketing topic should include:
- Purpose
- When to use / when not
- Definitions (strict)
- Inputs/Outputs
- Procedure (step-by-step)
- Templates (copy)
- QA gates (PASS/REWORK/FAIL)
- Related (UID-only where required)
- Compliance (no-fantasy + trace)

---

## 5) CORE QUALITY AXES (MARKETING)
Marketing topics should cover at least one axis explicitly:
- clarity of promise (positioning)
- specificity to audience (segments)
- platform fit (packaging)
- consistency and cadence (distribution)
- amplification system (launch window)
- engagement loops (community)
- discovery (SEO)
- conversion (offers)

---

## 6) HOW ENTITIES USE MARKETING TOPICS
- Marketing SPC: load positioning + packaging + channel strategy.
- ORC: uses marketing topics when orchestrating a release window.
- VAL/QA: validate packaging against tone/drift and anti-spam rules.
- Production roles: reference marketing topics for publish readiness.

---

## 7) EXAMPLES
GOOD:
- "Content Packaging: Titles, Hooks & Descriptions" (recipes + templates + QA)
- "Release Window" (schedule + KPI gates + post-mortem)

BAD:
- "Marketing thoughts" (no templates, no QA)
- "How to write lyrics" (music craft)

---
