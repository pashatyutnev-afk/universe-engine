# 10_META_EVOLUTION_ENGINES — REALM README (CANON)
FILE: 03_SYSTEM_ENTITIES/10_ENG__ENGINES/10_META_EVOLUTION_ENGINES/00__README__META_EVOLUTION_ENGINES.md

SCOPE: Universe Engine
LAYER: 03_SYSTEM_ENTITIES
ENTITY_GROUP: ENGINES (ENG)
DOC_TYPE: README
FAMILY: 10_META_EVOLUTION_ENGINES
CLASS: META (L4)
LEVEL: L4
STATUS: ACTIVE
LOCK: FIXED
VERSION: 1.0.0
UID: UE.ENG.FAM.10.README.001
OWNER: SYSTEM
ROLE: Realm definition for Meta Evolution engines: learning loop, pattern capture, optimization, bounded mutation, future projection, and strict governance routing (no direct canon edits).

CHANGE_NOTE:
- DATE: 2026-01-08
- TYPE: MAJOR
- SUMMARY: "Family README created: defines meta-evolution scope, canon order, and governance routing."
- REASON: "System evolution must be deterministic and canon-safe."
- IMPACT: "Improvements become auditable, prioritized, and routed through governance."
- CHANGE_ID: UE.CHG.2026-01-08.META.EVOLUTION.README.001

## 0) PURPOSE (LAW)
This FAMILY owns **META EVOLUTION**:
- learning capture (lessons, hypotheses, change candidates)
- pattern extraction (reusable patterns)
- optimization (objective/scoring/backlog)
- creative mutation (bounded exploration variants)
- future projection (scenarios/roadmaps)

Hard rule:
- Meta engines do not change canon directly. They produce artifacts that route through governance pipeline.

---

## 1) BOUNDARIES (STRICT)
IN SCOPE:
- creating evidence-backed learning artifacts
- extracting and formalizing reusable patterns
- prioritizing change candidates deterministically
- generating bounded exploration variants with safety constraints
- producing scenario/roadmap projections with triggers and routing

OUT OF SCOPE:
- executing canon changes directly (governance executes)
- writing domain content (narrative/character/world)
- acting as QA owner (meta consumes QA outputs)

CRITICAL RULE:
- Any canon-impacting change must go through:
  - Change Control Engine
  - Decision Approval Engine (if required)
  - Audit Log Engine (append-only record)

---

## 2) CANON ORDER (MANDATORY)
Engines in this family are canonical in this order:

01 — Learning Engine  
02 — Pattern Extraction Engine  
03 — Optimization Engine  
04 — Creative Mutation Engine  
05 — Future Projection Engine

Notes:
- 02 can feed 03 (patterns inform scoring).
- 04 outputs variants that must be evaluated by 01/03 before governance.
- 05 generates projected backlog that informs future 03 cycles.

## 4) CANON MAP (RAW-ONLY NAV)
01 — Learning Engine  
RAW: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pashatyutnev-afk/universe-engine/refs/heads/main/03_SYSTEM_ENTITIES/10_ENG__ENGINES/10_META_EVOLUTION_ENGINES/01__LEARNING_ENG.md

02 — Pattern Extraction Engine  
RAW: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pashatyutnev-afk/universe-engine/refs/heads/main/03_SYSTEM_ENTITIES/10_ENG__ENGINES/10_META_EVOLUTION_ENGINES/02__PATTERN_EXTRACTION_ENG.md

03 — Optimization Engine  
RAW: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pashatyutnev-afk/universe-engine/refs/heads/main/03_SYSTEM_ENTITIES/10_ENG__ENGINES/10_META_EVOLUTION_ENGINES/03__OPTIMIZATION_ENG.md

04 — Creative Mutation Engine  
RAW: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pashatyutnev-afk/universe-engine/refs/heads/main/03_SYSTEM_ENTITIES/10_ENG__ENGINES/10_META_EVOLUTION_ENGINES/04__CREATIVE_MUTATION_ENG.md

05 — Future Projection Engine  
RAW: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pashatyutnev-afk/universe-engine/refs/heads/main/03_SYSTEM_ENTITIES/10_ENG__ENGINES/10_META_EVOLUTION_ENGINES/05__FUTURE_PROJECTION_ENG.md

## 5) OUTPUT TARGETS (DEFAULT)
Default storage (recommended):
- PROJECT_ARTIFACTS/<project>/META/LEARNING/
- PROJECT_ARTIFACTS/<project>/META/PATTERNS/
- PROJECT_ARTIFACTS/<project>/META/OPTIMIZATION/
- PROJECT_ARTIFACTS/<project>/META/MUTATION/
- PROJECT_ARTIFACTS/<project>/META/PROJECTION/

---

## 6) USAGE PIPELINE (DETERMINISTIC)
1) Capture lessons and candidates (01).
2) Extract reusable patterns (02).
3) Rank and plan changes (03).
4) Explore bounded variants (04).
5) Project roadmap and future backlog (05).
6) Route selected canon-impacting changes to governance:
   - Change Control → Decision Approval (if needed) → Audit Log (append-only)

Validation:
- Each meta engine emits gates. Any S0 fail = STOP.

---

## 7) HARD BOUNDARY NOTES (CRITICAL)
- Meta engines cannot “hotfix” canon.
- All canon changes must be explicit, routed, and audited.
- Prefer deterministic scoring and bounded exploration over intuition-only edits.

--- END.
