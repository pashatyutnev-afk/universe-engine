# README TEMPLATE — GENRE & STYLE ENGINES (ENG) — CANON FILE: 03_SYSTEM_ENTITIES/10_ENG__ENGINES/06_GENRE_STYLE_ENGINES/00__TEMPLATE__README__GENRE_STYLE_ENGINES.md
SCOPE: Universe Engine
LAYER: 03_SYSTEM_ENTITIES
ENTITY_GROUP: ENGINES (ENG)
DOC_TYPE: TEMPLATE
TEMPLATE_TYPE: README
FAMILY: 06_GENRE_STYLE_ENGINES
CLASS: STYLE (L3)
LEVEL: L3
STATUS: ACTIVE
LOCK: FIXED
VERSION: 1.0.0
UID: UE.TPL.ENG.STYLE.README.001
OWNER: SYSTEM
ROLE: Stamp template for the family realm README inside 06_GENRE_STYLE_ENGINES. Defines ownership, anti-duplication boundaries, canon order, and routing.

CHANGE_NOTE:
- DATE: 2026-01-08
- TYPE: MAJOR
- SUMMARY: "Created canonical README template for 06_GENRE_STYLE_ENGINES: realm ownership, boundaries, canon order, routing, S0 blockers."
- REASON: "Stamping requires uniform family realm skeleton."
- IMPACT: "Style family becomes deterministic and non-overlapping."
- CHANGE_ID: UE.CHG.2026-01-08.TPL.STYLE.README.001

## HOW TO USE (STAMP RULE)
1) Copy this template into:
   `06_GENRE_STYLE_ENGINES/00__README__GENRE_STYLE_ENGINES.md`
2) Replace placeholders with concrete values.
3) Keep CANON ORDER exact and aligned with index.
4) Ensure collision routing prevents overlap with narrative/expression/production.

## 0) PURPOSE (LAW)
Define what STYLE family owns:
- tone/mood/atmosphere as stylistic primitives
- emotional resonance as effect layer
- symbolism/metaphor as meaning-carriers (style-layer, not narrative theme)
- sensory detail as rendering contract

Hard rule:
- This family defines *how it feels/sounds/reads stylistically*, not *what happens*.

---

## 1) OWNERSHIP (IN SCOPE)
IN SCOPE (OWNED):
- tone profile and mood ranges
- atmosphere layers and consistent “feel”
- emotional resonance patterns and target effects
- symbolic systems and metaphor rules (as style tools)
- sensory detail banks and insertion constraints

---

## 2) HARD NON-GOALS (FORBIDDEN OWNERSHIP)
This family MUST NOT own:
- narrative structure, pacing story-time, foreshadow/twist logic (NARRATIVE)
- event primitives and conflict/climax/resolution (EXPRESSION)
- character psychology/motivation/values as primary (CHARACTER)
- world laws, epochs, civilizations (WORLD)
- editing rhythm / cinematography / sound production (PRODUCTION)
- canon authority/audit/versioning/pipeline (GOVERNANCE)

---

## 3) COLLISION ROUTING (MANDATORY)
- “What happens / plot order / beats” → Narrative/Expression families
- “Story-time pacing” → 02_DOMAIN_NARRATIVE_ENGINES/05__PACING_RHYTHM_ENG
- “Screen-time rhythm / montage” → 08_KNOWLEDGE_PRODUCTION_ENGINES/07__EDITING_MONTAGE_ENG
- “Theme as thesis” → 02_DOMAIN_NARRATIVE_ENGINES/10__THEME_MEANING_ENG
- “Symbol/metaphor as technique” → this family (04/05 engines)
- “World belief/mythology content” → 04_DOMAIN_WORLD_ENGINES/09__MYTHOLOGY_BELIEF_ENG

---

## 4) CANON ORDER (MANDATORY)
01 — Tone & Mood Engine  
02 — Atmosphere Engine  
03 — Emotional Resonance Engine  
04 — Symbolism Engine  
05 — Metaphor Engine  
06 — Sensory Detail Engine  

---

## 5) OUTPUT CONTRACT (FAMILY)
Every engine must:
- have MINI-CONTRACT (concrete)
- have BOUNDARIES (IN/OUT + collision rule)
- have OUTPUT SCHEMAS for every PRODUCES
- have S0 BLOCKERS
- be runnable deterministically from inputs

---

## 6) S0 BLOCKERS (FAMILY LEVEL)
- S0-1: Engine claims ownership of narrative/expression/production primitives.
- S0-2: Engine outputs are vibes only (no schema/validation).
- S0-3: Symbol/metaphor overlaps with narrative theme without routing.
- S0-4: Missing raw-links/templates in index context.
- S0-5: Missing canon order or broken numbering.

---

## 7) RAW LINKS (MANDATORY)
