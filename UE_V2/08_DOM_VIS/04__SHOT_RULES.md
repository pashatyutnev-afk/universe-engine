TITLE: SHOT RULES (CAMERA / LENS / MOTION)

## MARKERS
- [M] LENS
- [M] MOTION
- [M] FRAMING
- [M] LIGHT
- [M] EDITING

## [M] LENS
- default: 35mm cinematic lens
- shallow depth of field
- realistic film grain (subtle)

## [M] MOTION
- subtle handheld sway + smooth forward motion
- no drone, no overhead unless explicitly allowed
- avoid fast whip pans (unless impact beat is declared)

## [M] FRAMING
- keep subject readable (single figure)
- low angle / follow shot / close-up cycles allowed
- do not change to wide establishing shots too often (continuity priority)

## [M] LIGHT
- consistent logic: neon reflections, rain, fog/steam
- keep contrast high but not crushed (details in blacks must exist)

## [M] EDITING
- prefer single-shot continuity feel
- if “hall transformation” beat occurs: 1 quick morph, then snap back
