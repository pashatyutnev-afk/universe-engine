# MAP — ENG → ORC (CANON)
FILE: 03_SYSTEM_ENTITIES/90_XREF__CROSSREF/01__MAP__ENG_to_ORC.md

SCOPE: Universe Engine
LAYER: 03_SYSTEM_ENTITIES
ENTITY_GROUP: CROSSREF (XREF)
DOC_TYPE: MAP
MAP_TYPE: ENG_TO_ORC
LEVEL: L2
STATUS: ACTIVE
LOCK: FIXED
VERSION: 1.0.0
UID: UE.XREF.MAP.ENG_ORC.001
OWNER: SYSTEM
ROLE: Canonical dependency map: which ORCHESTRATORS (ORC) are allowed/expected to call which ENGINES (ENG).
RAW-only navigation. No guessing links.

CHANGE_NOTE:
- DATE: 2026-01-12
- TYPE: MAJOR
- SUMMARY: "Created ENG→ORC canonical map with initial coverage: CORE_ORCHESTRATORS + MUSIC_ORCHESTRATORS."
- REASON: "Deterministic orchestration: ORC must know which ENG families it is allowed to invoke."
- IMPACT: "Cross-layer determinism + auditability; missing records are NON-CANON."
- CHANGE_ID: UE.CHG.2026-01-12.XREF.MAP.ENG_ORC.001

---

## 0) PURPOSE (LAW)
This MAP defines canonical links:
- ORC → calls/uses ENG (dependency set)
- It does NOT define sequence (that is PIPELINES MAP).
- It does NOT define SPC usage (that is ORC→SPC MAP).

---

## 1) SCOPE
Included in v1.0.0:
- 01_CORE_ORCHESTRATORS (narrative/character/world/production/pipeline)
- 10_MUSIC_ORCHESTRATORS (group→album, album→track, test→doc gate, release pack, portfolio planner, poet pack)

Out of scope (future expansion):
- additional ORC realms (if added later)

---

## 2) FORMAT (MANDATORY)
Each CANON RECORD is:

RECORD:
- ORC_RAW:
- ORC_ROLE:
- CALLS_ENG (RAW list):
- NOTES (optional)

RULE:
- If an ORC calls an ENG that is not listed here → NON-CANON until registered.

# 3) CANON RECORDS — ENG → ORC
