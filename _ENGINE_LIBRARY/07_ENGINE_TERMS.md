# ENGINE_LIBRARY/07_ENGINE_TERMS
## Canonical Terms & Definitions (L0 · Machine Grade)

---

## 0) STATUS

- Layer: L0
- Object: Canonical Terminology
- Authority: Governance Layer
- Scope: Entire System (ENGINES, SPECIALISTS, KNOWLEDGE_BASE)
- Binding: Absolute

Absolute Rule:
> A term not defined here must not appear in canonical documents.

---

## 1) PURPOSE

This document defines the **only allowed meanings** of system terms.
Its goals are:
- eliminate ambiguity
- prevent authority drift
- ensure cross-engine compatibility
- enable deterministic reviews and audits

Interpretation is forbidden.  
Only definitions below are valid.

---

## 2) CORE ENTITIES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

### Engine
A formal system entity that **executes a protocol and rules**.
An Engine does not reason, interpret, or decide unless explicitly defined.

Key properties:
- deterministic behavior
- bounded responsibility
- protocol-driven execution

---

### Specialist
An entity that **forms structured Intent**.
A Specialist:
- does NOT execute engines directly
- does NOT approve canon
- does NOT write audit facts

Role:
> Specialists propose. Engines execute. Governance decides.

---

### Governance
The authority layer that **approves, rejects, or blocks** actions
affecting canon, rules, or irreversible state.

Properties:
- explicit approval
- traceable decisions
- no execution of production tasks

---

### Canon
The set of **approved, authoritative truths** of the system.

Rules:
- Canon changes only via Governance
- Canon is not “eventually consistent”
- Canon must be auditable

---

### Audit Log
An **append-only, immutable record of facts**.

Rules:
- facts only (no interpretation)
- no deletion
- no modification
- absence of a record = absence of fact

---

### Knowledge Base
A **read-only informational layer**.

Rules:
- does not decide
- does not execute
- does not override canon
- rejected if conflicting with canon

Knowledge informs.  
Canon decides.

---

## 3) OPERATIONAL CONCEPTS

### Intent
A structured, explicit expression of desired action or outcome,
created by a Specialist or system component.

Rules:
- Intent is not execution
- Intent must be structured
- Intent must be traceable

---

### Execution
The act of performing an action according to a protocol,
carried out exclusively by an Engine.

Execution requires:
- valid request
- authorization (if applicable)
- protocol compliance

---

### Request
A formal submission to an Engine to consider execution.

Rules:
- must reference Intent
- must respect access rules
- may be rejected without execution

---

### Result
The explicit outcome of an execution.

Rules:
- success / failure / rejection must be explicit
- partial success must be declared as failure
- results are artifacts, not assumptions

---

## 4) TRACE & IDENTITY TERMS

### trace_id
A system-generated immutable identifier
linking intent → request → execution → audit facts.

Rules:
- must propagate across steps
- must not be dropped
- must not fork without rule

---

### intent_id
An identifier generated by a Specialist
to uniquely represent an Intent.

Rules:
- stable across revisions
- referenced by requests

---

### revision_id
A monotonically increasing identifier
representing iterations of the same intent.

Rules:
- resets only with new intent_id

---

## 5) LEVELS & HIERARCHY

### L0 — Meta Layer
Standards, methods, templates, terms.
No execution.

---

### L1 — System Core
Governance, Audit, Canon, Integrity.
Failure often requires system halt.

---

### L2 — System Services
Support and coordination services.
Failure degrades but must not corrupt canon.

---

### L3 — Domain / Production
Content generation and domain logic.
No authority over canon or governance.

---

## 6) SPECIALIST LEVELS

### S1 — Lead Specialist
Coordinates multiple S2 intents.
Handles conflict resolution and escalation.
No execution authority.

---

### S2 — Production Specialist
Forms intents within a specific domain.
Operates strictly through engines and trace.

---

## 7) FAILURE & SEVERITY TERMS

### CRITICAL
A violation that threatens system integrity.
Reaction: halt or immediate governance escalation.

---

### MAJOR
A violation that breaks rules but not core integrity.
Reaction: reject, block, review.

---

### MINOR
A non-fatal deviation.
Reaction: warn, adjust, document.

Silent failure is forbidden at all levels.

---

## 8) FORBIDDEN TERMS & USAGES

The following are forbidden in canonical documents:

- “Auto-approve”
- “Best effort”
- “Eventually consistent canon”
- “Temporary bypass”
- “Log later”
- “Admin exception”
- “Smart engine” (without formal definition)

---

## 9) TERM CHANGE POLICY

- New terms require Governance approval
- Redefinition of existing terms is forbidden
- Deprecated terms must be explicitly marked and replaced

---

## 10) CANON STATEMENT

Words define power.
Power without definition corrupts systems.
