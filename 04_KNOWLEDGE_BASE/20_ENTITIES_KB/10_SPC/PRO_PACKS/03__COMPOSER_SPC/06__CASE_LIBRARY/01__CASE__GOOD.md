## CONTEXT
Shorts-friendly track needs hook readability within first seconds; arrangement must stay clean.

---

## INPUTS (MIN)
- TASK_GOAL: "Short-form track with immediate hook readability."
- PLATFORM_INTENT: "shorts"
- CONSTRAINTS:
  - hook spotlight early
  - avoid clutter
  - clear peak/dip

---

## OUTPUTS (ABBREVIATED)

### O1 — PRODUCER_TASK_CARD
- Acceptance:
  - A1 hook spotlight within <=10–12s (readability)
  - A2 lead has space in hook section (no clutter)
  - A3 contrast lever at 0:28–0:40, anchors stable
- Anchors:
  - groove identity (kick/snare intent + pulse feel)
  - hook spotlight rule (lead foreground)
  - layer hierarchy (lead > support > bed)

### O2 — ARRANGEMENT_EXEC_PLAN
- Layer roles by section:
  - Intro/Hook-expose: lead + minimal support + pulse bed
  - Build: add mid-support, keep lead space
  - Contrast: one lever = rhythm density (adds motion, not new melody)
  - Return: strip back to lead focus (reset)
- Energy curve:
  - peak at contrast, dip at return reset
- Transitions:
  - into contrast: short stop/fill intent
  - out of contrast: drop-reset intent
- Repetition control:
  - micro-variation tokens in supports, lead stays stable

---

## CHECKLIST / GATE OUTCOME
- CHK-READINESS: PASS
- CHK-QUALITY: PASS
- CHK-COMPLIANCE: PASS
- GATE-CORE_OUTPUT_QUALITY: PASS
- GATE-CONSISTENCY: PASS
- GATE-EDGE_CASES: N/A

---

## WHY THIS IS GOOD
- runnable layer map + clear hierarchy
- hook readability protected explicitly
- contrast defined as one lever
- transitions intent is specified
- no engineering / no prompt takeover

---

## RUBRIC (EXPECTED)
- Average >= 8.0
- No dimension below 7

---

## RERUN SET (IF PATCHED)
- UE.KB.SPC.PACK.MUSIC_PRODUCER.GATE.CONSISTENCY.001 (always)
