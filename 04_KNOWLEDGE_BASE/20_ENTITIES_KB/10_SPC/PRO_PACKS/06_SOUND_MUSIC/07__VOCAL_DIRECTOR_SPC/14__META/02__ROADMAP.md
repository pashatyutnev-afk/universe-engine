## 0) PURPOSE
This roadmap lists planned improvements and additions.
It does NOT define new operational rules.

---

## 1) NEAR-TERM (NEXT ITERATIONS)
- Add more tools (Txx):
  - micro-pronunciation risk tagging (RU stress hotspots) as NOTES-only (no lyric edits)
  - hook micro-timing hints template (performance-only)
  - “section label normalizer” variants for messy structures
- Expand prompt contracts:
  - platform-specific length limits / formatting patterns (SUNO/UDIO variants)
  - compact “negative spec library” snippets (reuse)
- Add output examples:
  - one filled MIN, one STD, one FULL example pack (using a public-domain lyric sample)
- Add QA harness:
  - a small “test set” checklist for quick listening verification (10s/15s cues)

---

## 2) MID-TERM
- Add cross-entity interfaces (notes only):
  - escalation templates that align with SONGWRITER / ARRANGER entities
  - consistent handoff fields (owner, line_id, must_keep, success_criteria)
- Add more case coverage:
  - sub-cases for RU consonant clusters / fast rap vs sung chorus
  - “hybrid vocal” drift cases
- Add “regression guard” guidance:
  - how to avoid undoing previous fixes when applying PB (one-axis reinforcement)

---

## 3) LONG-TERM
- Build a canonical evaluation sheet (manual scoring):
  - P0 clarity score
  - breath safety score
  - stacking safety score
  - arc lift score
- Add multi-genre presets (notes, not rules):
  - nu-metal rap-rock
  - synthwave pop
  - dark trap
