FILE: 04_KNOWLEDGE_BASE/40_RELATION_XREF/18__KB_SCOPE_CHARACTER_WHAT_GOES_THERE.md

SCOPE: Universe Engine
LAYER: 04_KNOWLEDGE_BASE
DOC_TYPE: KB_MODULE
KB_TYPE: STANDARD
LEVEL: L2
STATUS: DRAFT
LOCK: FIXED
VERSION: 1.0.0
UID: UE.KB.STD.SCOPE.CHARACTER.018
OWNER: SYSTEM
ROLE: Define the boundaries and required content types for Character topics: motivation/desire, psychology, trauma/growth, behavior, relationships, voice/dialogue behavior patterns, and character consistency gates; separated from narrative structure and world lore.

CHANGE_NOTE:
- DATE: 2026-01-14
- TYPE: MAJOR
- SUMMARY: "Defined KB_SCOPE.TOPICS.CHARACTER boundaries: motivation/psychology/behavior/relationships/voice/consistency."
- REASON: "Characters become flat or inconsistent without repeatable character craft modules and clear boundaries from narrative/world scopes."
- IMPACT: "Character specialists can build consistent, compelling characters with deterministic methods and QA gates."
- CHANGE_ID: UE.CHG.2026-01-14.KB.STD.018

## 0) PURPOSE (KB)
Character topics define how characters work internally and externally:
- motivation and desire
- psychology and moral values
- trauma and growth arcs
- behavior patterns and decision logic
- relationship dynamics
- character voice and dialogue behavior patterns
- consistency and evolution gates

---

## 1) ABSOLUTE BOUNDARIES
Character topics must NOT:
- define story structure or scene pacing (Narrative scope)
- define world history/geopolitics/economy facts (World scope)
- redefine KB governance/navigation (Meta/Governance)
- embed RAW links or act as an index

Character topics MAY:
- reference Narrative topics when character craft is applied in scenes
- reference World topics when environment constrains behavior
(Always keep character method central.)

---

## 2) ALLOWED CHARACTER TOPIC TYPES
Allowed:
- MOTIVATION / DESIRE MODELS (need vs want)
- VALUES & MORAL AXES (what they won’t cross)
- PSYCHOLOGY TOOLKITS (coping, defenses, triggers)
- TRAUMA → GROWTH MAPS (wound, belief, healing)
- BEHAVIOR PATTERNS (habits, tells, action defaults)
- RELATIONSHIP DYNAMICS (attachment, conflict loops)
- CHARACTER VOICE RULES (speech patterns, rhythm, vocabulary)
- CONSISTENCY CHECKS (does this action fit?)
- EVOLUTION SUPERVISION (what changes over time)

---

## 3) FORBIDDEN CHARACTER CONTENT
Forbidden:
- episode outlines and plot beats (narrative)
- encyclopedic “world bible” (world)
- marketing packaging/distribution (marketing)
- production pipelines (production)
- essays without procedures/templates/QA

---

## 4) REQUIRED STRUCTURE (MINIMUM)
Each Character topic should include:
- Purpose
- When to use / when not
- Definitions (strict)
- Inputs/Outputs
- Procedure (step-by-step)
- Templates (copy) (character card, voice card, relationship map)
- QA gates (PASS/REWORK/FAIL)
- Related (UID-only if required)
- Compliance (no-fantasy + trace)

---

## 5) CORE QUALITY AXES (CHARACTER)
Character topics should cover at least one axis explicitly:
- motivation clarity (what they want)
- internal conflict (values vs needs)
- behavioral tells (show, not tell)
- relationship tension/loyalty patterns
- voice distinctness (speech fingerprint)
- consistency under pressure
- growth plausibility

---

## 6) HOW ENTITIES USE CHARACTER TOPICS
- SPC character: load motivation + behavior + voice modules, then generate character actions/dialogue.
- Narrative SPC: may load character modules as inputs to a scene.
- VAL/QA: validate character consistency and voice distinctness.

---

## 7) EXAMPLES
GOOD:
- "Motivation & Desire Model" (card + tests)
- "Character Voice Fingerprint" (rules + samples + QA)
- "Relationship Conflict Loops" (map + triggers + resolution patterns)

BAD:
- "Season 1 plot summary" (narrative)
- "Geopolitics of planet X" (world)

---

## 8) RELATED (UID-ONLY)
XREF:
- XREF: UE.KB.STD.SCOPE.TOPICS.011 | WHY: character is a domain topics scope
- XREF: UE.KB.TOPIC.META.USAGE.001 | WHY: no-fantasy and trace rule apply
- XREF: UE.KB.DICT.XREF_RULES.005 | WHY: uid-only crossrefs
- XREF: UE.KB.STD.SCOPE.NARRATIVE.017 | WHY: character craft complements narrative scene work

--- END.
