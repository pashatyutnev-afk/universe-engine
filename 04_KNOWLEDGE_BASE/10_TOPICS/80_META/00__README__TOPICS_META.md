# TOPICS — META (README) (CANON)
FILE: 04_KNOWLEDGE_BASE/10_TOPICS/80_META/00__README__TOPICS_META.md

SCOPE: Universe Engine
LAYER: 04_KNOWLEDGE_BASE
REALM: 10_TOPICS / 80_META
DOC_TYPE: README
INDEX_TYPE: REALM_README
LEVEL: L2
STATUS: DRAFT
LOCK: FIXED
VERSION: 1.0.0
UID: UE.KB.README.TOPICS.META.001
OWNER: SYSTEM
ROLE: Orientation for META topics scope: meta-competence modules that improve how entities work (planning, trace, evaluation, failure recovery) without becoming governance law. Includes deterministic roadmap. No navigation authority.

CHANGE_NOTE:
- DATE: 2026-01-14
- TYPE: MAJOR
- SUMMARY: "Created META topics realm README: scope boundaries, usage order, and roadmap for meta-competence modules."
- REASON: "Entities need a controlled place for meta skills (planning/evaluation/recovery) that boosts quality without polluting governance."
- IMPACT: "More consistent execution, fewer drift errors, better QA discipline."
- CHANGE_ID: UE.CHG.2026-01-14.KB.TOPICS.META.README.001

## 0) PURPOSE (KB)
This realm contains META competence knowledge:
- how to plan work (task decomposition, minimal loading)
- how to maintain trace discipline (run trace usage patterns)
- how to evaluate quality consistently (rubrics, calibration usage)
- how to recover from failure modes (when to stop, when to rework)
- how to avoid “pattern repetition” and drift in outputs

Goal:
- improve execution quality across all domains by teaching “how to work”.

---

## 1) WHAT BELONGS HERE / WHAT DOES NOT
### BELONGS (IN-SCOPE)
- meta playbooks for execution (plan→do→check→iterate)
- meta checklists (readiness, drift detection, regression guard)
- meta templates (run notes, audit note patterns) when not already in governance
- pattern avoidance techniques (anti-cliché, anti-repetition) as operational methods
- cross-domain quality heuristics labeled as HEURISTIC (not law)

### DOES NOT BELONG (OUT-OF-SCOPE)
- governance laws (must live in 00_KB_GOVERNANCE)
- navigation authority / RAW registries (master index only)
- domain craft content (narrative/character/world/visual/sound/marketing)
- fictional entities or invented “systems” not grounded in canon docs

---

## 2) NAVIGATION RULE (STRICT)
- This README is NOT navigation authority.
- KB navigation/existence authority is ONLY:
  - `04_KNOWLEDGE_BASE/00__INDEX__KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md`
- Do not add RAW registries here.

---

## 3) HOW ENTITIES USE META TOPICS (DETERMINISTIC)
Use META when you need:
- a repeatable workflow
- evaluation consistency
- failure recovery
- drift/repetition control

Order:
1) Governance minimum set (no-fantasy, uid-only, trace).
2) META module (minimal) that matches the problem.
3) Domain modules required by the task.
4) Apply gates/checklists.
5) Emit RUN_TRACE.

---

## 4) FILL PLAN (ROADMAP: WHAT FILES WE MUST CREATE)
Roadmap list (not navigation authority).

### P1 — Execution discipline
- META__PLAN_DECOMPOSE_METHOD
- META__MINIMAL_LOADING_RULES (operational patterns)
- META__STOP_OR_REWORK_DECISION_PROTOCOL

### P1 — Drift & repetition control
- META__PATTERN_REPETITION_DETECT_AND_FIX
- META__QUALITY_REGRESSION_GUARD_METHOD

### P1 — QA consistency
- META__CALIBRATION_WITH_EXEMPLARS_METHOD
- META__RUBRIC_APPLICATION_PLAYBOOK

### P2 — Documentation meta
- META__CHANGE_NOTE_QUALITY_GUIDE
- META__AUDIT_RECORD_QUALITY_GUIDE

### P3 — Advanced
- META__NOVELTY_INJECTION_METHOD (controlled)
- META__MULTI_DOMAIN_SCOPE_SELECTION_MAP

---

## 5) STYLE RULES FOR META MODULES
- META must stay operational and short-loop.
- Label HEURISTICS explicitly (heuristic ≠ law).
- Avoid creating new laws here; if it becomes “must/must not” governance-level, move to governance realm.

---

## 6) HARD FAIL CONDITIONS
FAIL IF:
- this realm becomes a second governance law layer
- RAW registries appear here
- modules prescribe domain craft instead of execution methods
- invented facts/sources are presented as KB-backed truth

---
