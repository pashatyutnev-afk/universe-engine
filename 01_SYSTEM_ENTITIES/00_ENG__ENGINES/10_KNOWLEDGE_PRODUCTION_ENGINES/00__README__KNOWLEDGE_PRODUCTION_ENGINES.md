## 0. REALM STATUS

- REALM: 10_KNOWLEDGE_PRODUCTION_ENGINES
- CLASS: PRODUCTION (L3)
- ROLE: Convert narrative intent into production-ready media specifications
- STATUS: ACTIVE
- OWNER: System / Human
- BYPASS_ALLOWED: false (media specs are mandatory for consistent output)
- NON_CANON: true (production choices do not change canon facts)

### REALM ABSOLUTE RULE
> Production creates representation, not truth. Truth remains in canon + logs.

## 1. PURPOSE

Knowledge Production Engines generate **machine-grade media specs**:
- composition and framing
- art style constraints
- camera & cinematography rules
- lighting plans
- image generation prompts/specs
- video generation specs
- editing & montage rules
- sound & music packaging rules

They ensure:
- consistent visual/audio identity
- repeatable production results
- reduced ambiguity for generators and editors

---

## 2. WHAT THIS REALM PRODUCES

Primary artifacts:
- VISUAL_COMPOSITION_SPEC
- ART_STYLE_SPEC
- CAMERA_CINEMATOGRAPHY_SPEC
- LIGHTING_SPEC
- IMAGE_GENERATION_SPEC
- VIDEO_GENERATION_SPEC
- EDITING_MONTAGE_SPEC
- SOUND_MUSIC_PACKAGE

These artifacts feed:
- Production Orchestrator
- Prompt builders / generation pipelines
- Editors / compositors
- QA / validation layer

---

## 3. HARD RULES (REALM)

- Every spec must declare:
  - target medium (image/video)
  - aspect ratio / resolution
  - style constraints (positive + negative)
  - continuity constraints (what must stay stable)
  - deliverable format
- Specs must be reusable:
  - avoid one-off vagueness (“make it cool”).
- Production must respect:
  - tone/mood
  - genre constraints
  - platform constraints
- No canon mutation:
  - production cannot invent new truths unless explicitly flagged as “non-canon visualization”.

## 4. ENGINE LIST (ORDER IS MANDATORY)

00 — README (this file)

01 — Visual Composition Engine  
02 — Art Style Engine  
03 — Camera & Cinematography Engine  
04 — Lighting Engine  
05 — Image Generation Engine  
06 — Video Generation Engine  
07 — Editing & Montage Engine  
08 — Sound & Music Engine  

---

## 5. REQUIRED DEPENDENCIES (CROSS-LAYER)

Common dependencies:
- Tone & Mood outputs
- Atmosphere Layer Map
- Sensory Detail Schema (optional but powerful)
- Platform format target (short/series/youtube/game)
- Style realm (genre/style engines)

---

## 6. FINAL STATEMENT

If the narrative is the brain,
production specs are the nervous system.
They turn intent into controlled output.
