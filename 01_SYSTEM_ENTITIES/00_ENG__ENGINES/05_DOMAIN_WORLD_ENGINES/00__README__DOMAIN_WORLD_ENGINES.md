# 🌍 DOMAIN WORLD ENGINES — REALM README
## Canonical Realm Specification  
**LEVEL: L2 · DOMAIN LAYER · WORLD SYSTEM · MACHINE-GRADE**

---

## 0. REALM STATUS

- REALM: 05_DOMAIN_WORLD_ENGINES
- CLASS: DOMAIN
- DOMAIN: WORLD
- LEVEL: L2 (Domain Layer)
- STATUS: ACTIVE
- OWNER: System / Human
- BYPASS_ALLOWED: false (within world pipeline)
- NON_CANON: true (domain engines are non-canon authority by default)

### REALM ABSOLUTE RULE
> World engines define constraints and context; they must not override L1 Governance/Core rules.

---

## 1. PURPOSE

Domain World Engines define **how the world is structured, ruled, and evolves**.

They provide:
- world structure (spaces, factions, maps, layers)
- world laws (physics, magic, social rules)
- timeline & epochs (historical segmentation)
- civilization modeling (culture, institutions)
- conflict & power systems
- geopolitics (actors + moves)
- economy & resources (flows, scarcity)
- technology & magic (capabilities, limits)
- mythology & belief (meaning systems)
- environment & ecology (biomes, cycles)

These engines produce *world artifacts* used by narrative and production layers.

---

## 2. REALM CONTRACT (INPUT / OUTPUT)

### INPUT (what this realm accepts)
- project constraints (genre, tone, target realism)
- narrative constraints (needed settings, stakes)
- known canon facts (if any; from project registry)
- desired scope (planetary, multi-planetary, station-based, etc.)

### OUTPUT (what this realm produces)
- world maps and structure graphs
- law sets and constraint lists
- epoch timeline models
- civilization passports
- conflict/power matrices
- geopolitics actor maps
- economy/resource flow models
- technology/magic capability matrices
- belief/mythology frameworks
- ecology/environment stability rules

Outputs are non-binding unless registered/approved by project governance.

## 4. REQUIRED DEPENDENCIES (CROSS-LAYER)

Common requirements:
- Core State / Lifecycle (world state snapshots)
- Narrative Continuity (timeline consistency)
- Governance (change control if canonized)
- Index & UID specs (if entities are registered)

---

## 5. FORBIDDEN (DOMAIN MUST NOT)

- Declare canon authority
- Mutate standards/canon/indexes
- Introduce contradictions without explicit retcon flags (handled by governance)
- Produce infinite/undefined worlds without constraints

---

## 6. FINAL STATEMENT

A world is a constraint machine.
Define constraints, and stories become possible.
