# 🎬 PRODUCTION FORMAT ENGINES — REALM README
## Canonical Realm Specification  
**LEVEL: L3 · PRODUCTION FORMAT LAYER · OUTPUT PACKAGING · MACHINE-GRADE**

---

## 0. REALM STATUS

- REALM: 09_PRODUCTION_FORMAT_ENGINES
- CLASS: PRODUCTION (L3)
- ROLE: Convert system narrative assets into format-specific deliverables
- STATUS: ACTIVE
- OWNER: System / Human
- BYPASS_ALLOWED: false (format constraints are mandatory)
- NON_CANON: true (format does not change canon, only representation)

### REALM ABSOLUTE RULE
> Format changes how content is packaged, not what is true.

---

## 1. PURPOSE

Production Format Engines translate story assets into **deliverable-ready structures**:
- genre declaration and constraints
- genre blending rules
- format adaptation rules (book/series/short/youtube/game)
- pacing, chunking, and episode design
- output packaging metadata

They prevent:
- wrong pacing for platform
- wrong episode length logic
- “book logic” inside shorts
- inconsistent structure across episodes

---

## 2. WHAT THIS REALM PRODUCES

Primary artifacts produced in this realm:
- GENRE_PROFILE
- GENRE_BLEND_PROFILE
- FORMAT_ADAPTATION_SPEC
- BOOK_FORMAT_PACKAGE
- SERIES_EPISODE_PACKAGE
- SHORT_CONTENT_PACKAGE
- YOUTUBE_LONGFORM_PACKAGE
- GAME_NARRATIVE_PACKAGE

These artifacts feed:
- Production Orchestrator
- Scene Construction Engine (format constraints)
- Editing & Montage Engine
- Sound/Music & Visual pipelines

---

## 3. HARD RULES (REALM)

- Every produced artifact must declare:
  - format type
  - target duration/length range
  - structural unit (chapter/episode/beat/quest)
  - pacing constraints
- Adaptation must not break causality:
  - reordering is allowed only if the causal graph remains valid.
- Format engines must expose “budget” limits:
  - runtime/words/scenes/cuts.

## 5. REQUIRED DEPENDENCIES (CROSS-LAYER)

Common dependencies:
- Tone Profile + Mood Curve
- Pacing & Rhythm constraints
- Event Schedule (recommended)
- Climax/Resolution plans (recommended)
- Platform constraints refs (rating, length, monetization restrictions if any)

---

## 6. FINAL STATEMENT

Narrative is the substance.
Format is the container.
Pick the container — or the substance leaks.
