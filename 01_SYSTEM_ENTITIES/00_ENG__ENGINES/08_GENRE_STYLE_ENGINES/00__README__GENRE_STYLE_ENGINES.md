# 🎨 GENRE & STYLE ENGINES — REALM README
## Canonical Realm Specification  
**LEVEL: L3 · STYLE LAYER · AESTHETIC CONTROL · MACHINE-GRADE**

---

## 0. REALM STATUS

- REALM: 08_GENRE_STYLE_ENGINES
- CLASS: STYLE (L3)
- ROLE: Convert narrative intent into consistent tone/atmosphere/symbolic language
- STATUS: ACTIVE
- OWNER: System / Human
- BYPASS_ALLOWED: false (style coherence is a system requirement)
- NON_CANON: true (style does not set world canon)

### REALM ABSOLUTE RULE
> Style engines do not change what happens — they change how it is perceived and encoded.

---

## 1. PURPOSE

Genre & Style Engines define **how the story feels** and how meaning is delivered:
- tone & mood control
- atmosphere (environmental, social, sensory frame)
- emotional resonance patterns
- symbolism systems
- metaphor systems
- sensory detail density and distribution

They prevent:
- tonal drift
- incoherent vibe shifts
- accidental comedic framing in serious arcs
- symbol spam without meaning

---

## 2. WHAT THIS REALM PRODUCES

Primary artifacts produced in this realm:
- TONE_PROFILE
- MOOD_CURVE
- ATMOSPHERE_LAYER_MAP
- EMOTIONAL_RESONANCE_MAP
- SYMBOL_SYSTEM
- METAPHOR_SYSTEM
- SENSORY_DETAIL_SCHEMA

These artifacts feed:
- Scene Construction Engine
- Pacing & Rhythm Engine
- Production Orchestrator (visual/audio style)
- Dialogue & Speech Naturalization (subtext alignment)

---

## 3. HARD RULES (REALM)

- Tone must be explicit and stable per arc/sequence.
- Mood must be trackable (curve or states), not “whatever”.
- Atmosphere must support story stakes (not decorative noise).
- Symbolism must be:
  - bounded
  - consistent
  - mapped to meaning
- Metaphor must be:
  - coherent
  - aligned with world laws and theme constraints
- Sensory detail must be:
  - purposeful
  - paced
  - never drown causality

## 5. REQUIRED DEPENDENCIES (CROSS-LAYER)

Common dependencies:
- Narrative intent (genre target, audience, stakes)
- Constraints refs (platform, rating, taboo list if any)
- World package (optional but recommended for atmosphere/sensory realism)
- Character package (for resonance and tone compatibility)

---

## 6. FINAL STATEMENT

Structure moves the story.
Style makes the story land.
