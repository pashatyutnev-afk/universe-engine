# 🎭 EXPRESSION ENGINES — REALM README
## Canonical Realm Specification  
**LEVEL: L3 · EXPRESSION LAYER · SCENIC DYNAMICS · MACHINE-GRADE**

---

## 0. REALM STATUS

- REALM: 07_EXPRESSION_ENGINES
- CLASS: EXPRESSION (L3)
- ROLE: Convert structure into expressed narrative dynamics
- STATUS: ACTIVE
- OWNER: System / Human
- BYPASS_ALLOWED: false (expression order matters)
- NON_CANON: true (expression engines do not set canon authority)

### REALM ABSOLUTE RULE
> Expression engines do not invent the world — they express change inside it.

---

## 1. PURPOSE

Expression Engines define the **mechanics of dramatic motion**.

They operate between:
- domain logic (world/character/narrative structures)
and
- produced scenes (production layer)

They provide machine-grade tools for:
- events
- causality
- conflict
- turning points
- climax & resolution
- shocks
- scheduling
- controlled randomness

---

## 2. WHAT THIS REALM PRODUCES

Primary artifacts produced in this realm:
- EVENT_SPEC
- CAUSE_EFFECT_GRAPH
- CONFLICT_MODEL
- TURNING_POINT_MAP
- CLIMAX_BLUEPRINT
- RESOLUTION_PLAN
- SYSTEM_SHOCK_EVENT
- EVENT_SCHEDULE
- CHAOS_PROFILE

These artifacts are building blocks for:
- Scene Construction Engine
- Pacing & Rhythm Engine
- Tension & Stakes Engine
- Production Orchestrator

---

## 3. HARD RULES (REALM)

- Every event must have:
  - trigger
  - effect
  - cost
  - reversibility state
- Cause–effect must be explicit (no magic jumps unless priced by world laws)
- Conflict cannot exist without stakes and constraints
- Turning points must change trajectory (not “cool moments”)
- Climax must pay off seeded promises
- Resolution must close arcs or intentionally leave declared open loops
- Randomness is controlled and bounded (no plot sabotage)

## 5. REQUIRED DEPENDENCIES (CROSS-LAYER)

Common dependencies:
- Narrative Structure artifacts (structure, arc, scene list seeds)
- Character motivation/value constraints
- World lawset and capability bounds
- Governance audit/consistency (recommended)

---

## 6. FINAL STATEMENT

Structure defines the skeleton.
Expression defines motion.
