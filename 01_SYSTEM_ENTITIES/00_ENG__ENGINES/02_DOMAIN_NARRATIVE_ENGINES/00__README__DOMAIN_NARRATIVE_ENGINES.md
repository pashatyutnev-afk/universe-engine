# 📚 DOMAIN NARRATIVE ENGINES — REALM README
## Canonical Realm Specification  
**LEVEL: L2 · DOMAIN LAYER · NARRATIVE SYSTEM · MACHINE-GRADE**

---

## 0. REALM STATUS

- REALM: 03_DOMAIN_NARRATIVE_ENGINES
- CLASS: DOMAIN
- DOMAIN: NARRATIVE
- LEVEL: L2 (Domain Layer)
- STATUS: ACTIVE
- OWNER: System / Human
- BYPASS_ALLOWED: false (within narrative pipeline)
- NON_CANON: true (domain engines are non-canon authority by default)

### REALM ABSOLUTE RULE
> Domain Narrative Engines may generate structure and meaning, but they must never override L1 Governance/Core rules.

---

## 1. PURPOSE

Domain Narrative Engines define **how stories are constructed** inside the Universe Engine system.

They provide:
- narrative logic primitives
- story structure primitives
- scene and pacing composition rules
- continuity and theme enforcement mechanisms

These engines do not create system canon.
They create **domain outputs** that must still pass validation/governance if they become binding.

---

## 2. REALM CONTRACT (INPUT / OUTPUT)

### INPUT (what this realm accepts)
- World/Character constraints (as domain inputs)
- Narrative intent (genre, tone, target format)
- Events and state snapshots (from orchestrators)

### OUTPUT (what this realm produces)
- structured narrative plans (beats, arcs, sequences)
- scene specs
- continuity constraints
- thematic scaffolding
- domain-level verdicts (non-binding by themselves)

## 4. REQUIRED DEPENDENCIES (CROSS-LAYER)

This realm requires:
- Core Identity Engine (entity UID grounding)
- Core State + Core Lifecycle (state/phase references when used)
- Governance Audit Log (trace for pipeline outputs if needed)
- Governance Canon Authority (if any output attempts to become binding)

---

## 5. FORBIDDEN (DOMAIN MUST NOT)

- Declare canon authority
- Override governance decisions
- Bypass state/lifecycle gating
- Treat chat text as canon
- Mutate system standards or master indexes

---

## 6. FINAL STATEMENT

Narrative engines create meaning and structure.
Governance decides what becomes binding.
