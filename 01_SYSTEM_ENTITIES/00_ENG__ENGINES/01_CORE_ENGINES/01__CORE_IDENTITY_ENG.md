# 🧠 CORE IDENTITY ENGINE
## Canonical Engine Specification  
**LEVEL: L1 · CORE ENGINE · SYSTEM FOUNDATION · MACHINE-GRADE**

---

## 0. CANONICAL STATUS

- ENGINE_ID: L1-CORE-IDENTITY-ENGINE-001
- NAME: Core Identity Engine
- CLASS: Core Engine
- CATEGORY: System Core
- LEVEL: L1 (Foundational Layer)
- STATUS: FINAL
- AUTHORITY: Core Layer
- FAILURE_MODE: fail-closed
- AUDIT: mandatory (Audit Log Engine)
- READ_ONLY: true
- EDITABLE: false

### ABSOLUTE RULE
> If identity is undefined here —  
> it does not exist for the system.

---

## 1. PURPOSE

Core Identity Engine defines **the fact of existence** of any entity in the Universe Engine.

It establishes:
- what an entity **is**
- what an entity **is not**
- immutable identity boundaries

This engine is the **root of all system meaning**.

---

## 2. RESPONSIBILITY SCOPE

### DEFINES (IN-SCOPE)

- Entity existence
- Entity type
- Entity UID binding
- Entity class & category
- Immutable identity attributes
- Ontological boundaries

---

### FORBIDDEN (OUT-OF-SCOPE)

- Behavior definition
- Evolution or mutation
- Optimization
- Interpretation
- Content generation
- Decision-making
- Validation logic

Out-of-scope is absolute.

---

## 3. ENTITY TYPES REGISTERED

Core Identity Engine recognizes only canonical entity classes:

- ENGINE
- ORCHESTRATOR
- SPECIALIST
- CONTROLLER
- VALIDATOR
- MODEL
- PROJECT
- ARTIFACT

No other entity types are valid.

---

## 4. INPUT ARTIFACT — ENTITY_DECLARATION

Every entity **must** be declared before use.

### REQUIRED FIELDS

- `entity_uid`
- `entity_type`
- `entity_class`
- `entity_category`
- `entity_name`
- `origin_layer`
- `owner`
- `creation_timestamp`

Missing any field → **rejected**.

---

## 5. OUTPUT ARTIFACT — ENTITY_IDENTITY_RECORD

### GUARANTEED OUTPUT

- immutable UID
- canonical type binding
- class & category lock
- system-level recognition

Once issued — **never changes**.

---

## 6. ACCESS MODEL

### READ
- All system layers

### WRITE
- Governance Layer only

### EXECUTE
- Forbidden

---

## 7. DEPENDENCIES

### REQUIRED
- Audit Log Engine
- UID & Marking Specification
- System Canon

### FORBIDDEN
- Knowledge Base
- Specialists
- Production Engines

---

## 8. FAILURE CONDITIONS

### CRITICAL
- Entity without UID
- Duplicate UID
- Type mutation attempt
- Identity override

**Reaction:**
- Immediate halt
- Audit incident
- Governance escalation

---

## 9. TRACE & AUDIT

- Every declaration logged
- Every rejection logged
- Every conflict logged

Loss of trace = entity invalid.

---

## 10. NON-GOALS

- Does not explain entities
- Does not evolve entities
- Does not optimize entities
- Does not validate behavior

---

## 11. GOVERNANCE POSITION

Core Identity Engine:
- has no alternatives
- cannot be bypassed
- precedes all other engines
- defines system reality

Compromise of this engine  
= collapse of system ontology.

---

## 12. FINAL STATEMENT

Identity precedes logic.  
Logic precedes behavior.  
Behavior precedes output.

---

**STATUS:** Core Identity Engine v1.0  
**CANON:** FIXED · NON-NEGOTIABLE
