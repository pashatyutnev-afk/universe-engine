# 🧠 CORE ENGINES — REALM README
## Canonical Realm Specification  
**LEVEL: L1 · CORE LAYER · FOUNDATION · MACHINE-GRADE**

---

## 0. REALM STATUS

- REALM: 01_CORE_ENGINES
- CLASS: CORE
- LEVEL: L1 (System Foundation)
- STATUS: ACTIVE
- OWNER: System / Human
- BYPASS_ALLOWED: false

### REALM ABSOLUTE RULE
> If CORE invariants are not enforced, every downstream engine becomes non-deterministic.

---

## 1. PURPOSE

CORE Engines define the **non-negotiable primitives** of the Universe Engine system.

They guarantee:
- Identity invariants
- State invariants
- Lifecycle invariants

CORE does not interpret meaning and does not “create canon”.
CORE defines the minimum runtime reality of the system.

---

## 2. REALM CONTRACT (INPUT / OUTPUT)

### INPUT (what CORE accepts)
- Identity-bound requests (entity_uid required)
- State snapshots and transition requests
- Lifecycle phase transition requests

### OUTPUT (what CORE guarantees)
- Deterministic identity grounding
- Deterministic state model and transition gating
- Deterministic lifecycle model and phase gating
- Fail-closed behavior when invariants break

---

## 3. ENGINE LIST (ORDER IS MANDATORY)

00 — README (this file)

01 — Core Identity Engine  
- Defines identity primitives: UID / entity types / marking baseline.

02 — Core State Engine  
- Defines universal state schema, integrity rules, and state transitions contract.

03 — Core Lifecycle Engine  
- Defines lifecycle phases and allowed phase transitions for entities and artifacts.

---

## 4. REQUIRED DEPENDENCIES (CROSS-REALM)

CORE requires:
- Governance Audit Log Engine (all state/lifecycle events must be recorded)
- Governance Change Control Engine (schema/phase changes are controlled)

---

## 5. FORBIDDEN (CORE MUST NOT)

- Interpret domain meaning
- Make narrative decisions
- Write or edit canon
- Allow silent state mutation
- Allow lifecycle bypass

---

## 6. FINAL STATEMENT

CORE Engines are the foundation.
If CORE invariants are bypassed, the system is non-compliant by definition.
