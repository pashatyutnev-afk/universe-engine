# 🧬 META EVOLUTION ENGINES — REALM README
## Family Registry · Meta Layer (Learning / Patterns / Optimization)

## 0. CANONICAL STATUS

- FAMILY: 13_META_EVOLUTION_ENGINES
- CLASS: META (L4)
- LEVEL: L4
- STATUS: ACTIVE
- OWNER: Universe Engine
- PURPOSE: Engines that evolve the system behavior without breaking canon
- RULE_MODE: fail-closed on canon risk

### ABSOLUTE FAMILY RULE
> Meta engines may improve the system,  
> but may never mutate canon without governance approval.

---

## 1. FAMILY PURPOSE

This family exists to enable controlled evolution:
- learning from outcomes
- extracting reusable patterns
- optimizing pipelines
- introducing creative mutations safely
- projecting future states and risks

These engines operate on **observations, logs, metrics, and outputs**.
They do not create truth — they propose improvements.

---

## 2. SCOPE & LIMITS

### IN-SCOPE (ALLOWED)
- produce recommendations
- produce candidate improvements
- detect drift and degradation
- propose optimizations and experiments
- record learnings into controlled artifacts

### OUT-OF-SCOPE (FORBIDDEN)
- editing Canon directly
- deleting records or hiding failures
- bypassing Governance Engines
- changing numbering, UID rules, or index law

---

## 3. REQUIRED DEPENDENCIES

- Audit Log Engine (trace truth)
- Canon Authority Engine (what is mutable)
- Change Control Engine (how changes happen)
- Consistency Engine (coherence)
- Dependency Registry Engine (impact map)

---

## 4. OUTPUT ARTIFACT CLASSES (FAMILY)

Meta engines emit only these artifact types:

- `LEARNING_NOTE`
- `PATTERN_PACKAGE`
- `OPTIMIZATION_PROPOSAL`
- `MUTATION_CANDIDATE`
- `FUTURE_PROJECTION_REPORT`
- `EXPERIMENT_PLAN`
- `DRIFT_ALERT`

Each artifact must include:
- `trace_id` (when possible)
- `source_refs`
- `risk_level`
- `scope_impact_guess`
- `approval_required` (bool)

## 5. FAMILY ENGINE LIST (ORDER LOCKED)

00 — README — this file  
01 — Learning Engine — `01__LEARNING_ENG.md`  
02 — Pattern Extraction Engine — `02__PATTERN_EXTRACTION_ENG.md`  
03 — Optimization Engine — `03__OPTIMIZATION_ENG.md`  
04 — Creative Mutation Engine — `04__CREATIVE_MUTATION_ENG.md`  
05 — Future Projection Engine — `05__FUTURE_PROJECTION_ENG.md`

---

## 6. GOVERNANCE POSITION

Meta engines are **advisory by default**.

They may:
- propose
- evaluate
- recommend

They may not:
- enforce
- override
- rewrite canon

Any action that changes system behavior must pass:
Change Control → Decision Approval → Consistency → Audit Log.

---

## 7. FINAL STATEMENT

Evolution is allowed.  
Chaos is not.
