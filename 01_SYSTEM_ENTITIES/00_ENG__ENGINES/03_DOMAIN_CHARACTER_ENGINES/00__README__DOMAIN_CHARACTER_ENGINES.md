# 👤 DOMAIN CHARACTER ENGINES — REALM README
## Canonical Realm Specification  
**LEVEL: L2 · DOMAIN LAYER · CHARACTER SYSTEM · MACHINE-GRADE**

---

## 0. REALM STATUS

- REALM: 04_DOMAIN_CHARACTER_ENGINES
- CLASS: DOMAIN
- DOMAIN: CHARACTER
- LEVEL: L2 (Domain Layer)
- STATUS: ACTIVE
- OWNER: System / Human
- BYPASS_ALLOWED: false (within character pipeline)
- NON_CANON: true (domain engines are non-canon authority by default)

### REALM ABSOLUTE RULE
> Character engines may define people and psychology, but must never override L1 Governance/Core rules.

---

## 1. PURPOSE

Domain Character Engines define **how characters are built, simulated, and evolved** inside the Universe Engine system.

They provide:
- character core model (identity + invariants)
- motivations and desires (drives)
- values and morality (decision filters)
- psychology (internal dynamics)
- behavior (observable outputs)
- relationships (network constraints)
- dialogue intent and speech naturalization
- growth/trauma modeling
- evolution over arcs

These engines output *character artifacts* used by narrative/world engines.

---

## 2. REALM CONTRACT (INPUT / OUTPUT)

### INPUT (what this realm accepts)
- world constraints (laws, culture, tech level)
- narrative constraints (arc goals, stakes)
- role in story (protagonist, antagonist, mentor, etc.)
- past events and state snapshots (from continuity)

### OUTPUT (what this realm produces)
- character profiles and passports (domain-level)
- motivation maps and value matrices
- behavior predictions (tendencies)
- relationship maps
- dialogue intent specs (not final prose)
- growth/evolution plans

Outputs are non-binding unless registered/approved by project governance.

## 3. ENGINE LIST (ORDER IS MANDATORY)

00 — README (this file)

01 — Character Core Engine  
02 — Motivation & Desire Engine  
03 — Moral & Value Engine  
04 — Character Psychology Engine  
05 — Character Behavior Engine  
06 — Relationship Engine  
07 — Dialogue Engine  
08 — Speech Naturalization Engine  
09 — Growth & Trauma Engine  
10 — Character Evolution Engine

---

## 4. REQUIRED DEPENDENCIES (CROSS-LAYER)

This realm commonly requires:
- Core Identity Engine (UID grounding if used in system)
- Core State + Core Lifecycle (character state across phases)
- Narrative Continuity Engine (history + knowledge continuity)
- World constraints (culture/laws/tech)

If trace-bound in pipeline:
- Audit Log Engine (record pipeline trace)

---

## 5. FORBIDDEN (DOMAIN MUST NOT)

- Declare canon authority
- Override governance decisions
- Mutate standards/canon/indexes
- Treat chat text as canonical truth source
- Produce irreversible character changes without explicit evolution record

---

## 6. FINAL STATEMENT

Characters are systems.
A character without invariants, drives, and constraints is noise.
